# Trucking

Simple site created in Gatsby.js, React, Contentful and Styled Components.

## Development

Make sure that you have the Gatsby CLI program installed:

```sh
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Before running you need set accessToken to Contentful in gatsby-config.js. I don't publish it to public repo because of security reasons.

Run in development mode:

```sh
gatsby develop
```
